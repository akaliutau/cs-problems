/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/
 * 
 * Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible
 * increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing
 * subsequence should be at least 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: [4, 6, 7, 7] 
 * Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of the given array will not exceed 15. The range of integer in the
 * given array is [-100,100].
 * 
 * The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be
 * considered as a special case of increasing sequence
