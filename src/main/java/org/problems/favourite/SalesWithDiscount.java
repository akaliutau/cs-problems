/**
 * Big Sales With Discount
 * 
 * A shopkeeper has a sale to complete and has arranged the items being sold in
 * a list. Starting from the left, the shop keeper rings up each item:
 *  at its full price - the price of the first lower or equally priced item to its
 * right. 
 *  If there is no item to the right that costs less than or equal to the
 * current item's price the current item is sold at full price.
 * 
 * For example, assume there are items priced [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2]. The first and
 * second items would each be discounted by 1 unit, the first equal or lower
 * price to the right. The item priced 1 unit would sell at a full price. The
 * next item, at 2 units, would be discounted 2 units as would the 4 unit item.
 * The sixth and final item must be purchased at full price. The total cost is
 * 1+2+1+0+2+2 = 8 units.
 * 
 * Print total cost of all items on the first line. On the second line print a
 * space separated list of integers representing the indexes of the non-
 * discounted items in ascending index order.
 * 
 * 1 <= size(prices) <= 10^5 
 * 1 <= prices <= 10^5
 * 
 * Output: 
 * 8 
 * 2 5
 * 
 * Input 2: [5,1,3,4,6,2] 
 * Output: 
 * 14 
 * 1 5
 * 
 * Input 3: [1,3,3,2,5] 
 * Output: 
 * 9 
 * 0 3 4
 *
